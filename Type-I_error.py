A machine fills milk bottles, the mean amount of milk in each bottle is supposed to
be 32 Oz with a standard deviation of 0.06 Oz. Suppose the mean amount of milk is
approximately normally distributed. To check if the machine is operating properly, 36
filled bottles will be chosen at random and the mean amount will be determined.
